1. **Penicillin Discovery**: In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the first widely used antibiotic, when he noticed that a mold growing on a petri dish in his lab inhibited bacterial growth. 
This accidental observation led to the isolation of penicillin, which transformed medicine by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections like pneumonia and sepsis, previously often fatal. 
By the 1940s, mass production of penicillin saved countless lives during World War II, marking the beginning of the antibiotic era, though overuse later contributed to antimicrobial resistance.
