Suffer not yourselves\\nto be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our\\npetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and\\ndarken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\\nreconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that\\nforce must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,\\nsir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to --- sir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to\\nwhich kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\\nits purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other\\npossible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\\nthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,\\nshe has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.\\nThey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British\\nministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?\\nShall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.\\nHave we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the\\nsubject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we\\nfind which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir, --- find which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,\\ndeceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert\\nthe storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\\nwe have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have\\nimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and\\nParliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced\\nadditional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;\\nand we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!\\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\\nreconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free--\\nif we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which\\nwe have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\\nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged --- struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged\\nourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest\\nshall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!\\nAn appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us! --- They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\\nan adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,\\nor the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\\nguard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength but\\nirresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance\\nby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until\\nour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make\\na proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\\nThe millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a\\ncountry as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy\\ncan send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will\\nraise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the --- raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the\\nstrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,\\nwe have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late\\nto retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!\\nOur chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!\\nThe war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come. --- It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\\nbut there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\\nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\\nOur brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish?

United. . .there is\\nlittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\\nDivided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\\na powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\\nwe pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\\nhave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\\nWe shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\\nBut we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\\nown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\\nfoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\\nstruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\\nefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\\nis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it, --- efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\\nis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,\\nnot because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\\nIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\\nit cannot save the few who are rich. --- To our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\\nto convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\\n. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\\npoverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of\\nhostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them\\nto oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let\\nevery other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master\\nof its own house.\\n\\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .\\nour last best hope in an age where the instruments of war\\nhave far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge\\nof support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for\\ninvective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .\\nand to enlarge the area in which its writ may run. --- Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,\\nwe offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew\\nthe quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed\\nby science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient\\nbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\\nour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\\nboth rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\\nto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind\\'s\\nfinal war. --- So let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\\nis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\\nLet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\\nthose problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,\\nformulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\\ncontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\\nother nations under the absolute control of all nations.\\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\\nof its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the\\ndeserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage\\nthe arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners\\nof the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to \"undo the heavy burdens. . .\\nlet the oppressed go free.\" --- And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .\\nlet both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .\\nbut a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .\\nand the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .\\n\\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\\nNor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .\\nnor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps\\nin our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin. --- In your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the\\nfinal success or failure of our course.

The graves of young Americans who answered\\nthe call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .\\nnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\\nthough embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\\ntwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\\npatient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\\ntyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against\\nthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .\\nEast and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\\nWill you join in that historic effort? --- In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\\nthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink\\nfrom this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us\\nwould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\\nThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\\nwill light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\\nthat fire can truly light the world.\\n\\nAnd so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can\\ndo for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow\\ncitizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,\\nbut what together we can do for the Freedom of Man. --- Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\\nwhich we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,\\nwith history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\\nthe land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that\\nhere on earth God\\'s work must truly be our own.\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember, 1974  [Etext #4]\\n\\n\\n**The Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln\\'s Gettysburg Address**\\n\\n\\nThis is a retranscription of one of the first Project\\nGutenberg Etexts, offically dated December 31, 1974--\\nand now officially re-released on November 19, 1993--\\n130 years after it was spoken.

We are met on a great battlefield of that war.\\n\\nWe have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place\\nfor those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.\\nIt is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\\n\\nBut, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate. . .we cannot consecrate. . .\\nwe cannot hallow this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,\\nwho struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power\\nto add or detract.

But different\\nmen often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it\\nwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do\\nopinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my\\nsentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.\\nThe questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country.\\nFor my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of\\nfreedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject\\nought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that\\nwe can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility\\nwhich we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions\\nat such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself\\nas guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty --- Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\\nand, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\\ntemporal salvation?

Then a statement, somewhat\\nin detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\\nNow, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\\nhave been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great\\ncontest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies\\nof the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress\\nof our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known\\nto the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory\\nand encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction\\nin regard to it is ventured. --- On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts\\nwere anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--\\nall sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered\\nfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\\ninsurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--\\nseeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather\\nthan let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather\\nthan let it perish.  And the war came. --- One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\\ninsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\\nno right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. --- Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\\nto the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God\\'s\\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men\\'s faces;\\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both\\ncould not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully. --- The Almighty has his own purposes.  \"Woe unto the world because\\nof offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe\\nto that man by whom the offense cometh.\"  If we shall suppose\\nthat American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the\\nprovidence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\\nthrough his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\\ngives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due\\nto those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any\\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a\\nliving God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently\\ndo we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\\nYet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\\nthe bondsman\\'s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil\\nshall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash\\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\\nthree thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The --- With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\\nto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation\\'s wounds;\\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\\nand his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember, 1979  [Etext #9]\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln\\'s 1st Inaugural Address\\n\\n\\n\\nLincoln\\'s First Inaugural Address\\nMarch 4, 1861\\n\\n\\n\\nFellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\\nas the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\\nand to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\\nof the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\\non the execution of his office.\"\\n\\nI do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters\\nof administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement. --- Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States\\nthat by the accession of a Republican administration their property\\nand their peace and personal security are to be endangered.\\nThere has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.\\nIndeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while\\nexisted and been open to their inspection.  It is found in\\nnearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\\nI do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\\n\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\\nthe institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have\\nno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\\nthat I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\\nnever recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\\nplatform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\\nthe clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: --- \"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\\nof the rights of the States, and especially\\nthe right of each State to order and control\\nits own domestic institutions according to\\nits own judgment exclusively, is essential\\nto that balance of power on which the perfection\\nand endurance of our political fabric depend,\\nand we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory,\\nno matter under what pretext,\\nas among the gravest of crimes.\"\\n\\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\\nis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\\nare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\\nI add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\\nConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\\nto all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\\nas cheerfully to one section as to another. --- There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\\nfrom service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\\nwritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\\n\\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State,\\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another,\\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor,\\nbut shall be delivered up on claim of the party\\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\" --- It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\\nand the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\\nof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\\nto this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\\nthen, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\\n\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\\nwould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\\nequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\\nthat unanimous oath? --- There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\\nbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\\ndifference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\\nsurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\\nby which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\\ncontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\\ncontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\\n\\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\\nso that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\\nAnd might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\\nenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\\n\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and\\nimmunities of citizens in the several States?\" --- I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\\nand with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\\nany hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\\nparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\\nthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\\nto conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\\nthan to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\\nthem held to be unConstitutional. --- It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\\nunder our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\\nthe executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\\nmany perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\\nof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted. --- I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\\nthe Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\\nif not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\\nIt is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\\nin its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\\nthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\\nendure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\\nnot provided for in the instrument itself.\\n\\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\\nbe peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\\nbut does it not require all to lawfully rescind it? --- Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition\\nthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\\nthe history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\\nthe Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\\nAssociation in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\\nand the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\\nin 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\\nand establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"\\n\\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\\nhaving lost the vital element of perpetuity. --- It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\\nto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\\nwithin any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\\nare insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\\n\\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\\nthe Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\\nas the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\\nlaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\\nDoing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\\nand I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\\nrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\\nrequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\\nI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\\ndefend and maintain itself. --- In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\\nThe power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\\nthe property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\\nthe duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\\nanywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\\nshall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\\nfrom holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\\nobnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\\nlegal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\\nthese offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\\nand so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\\nto forego for the time the uses of such offices. --- The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\\nof the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\\nand reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\\na hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\\n\\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\\nthe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\\nto them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak? --- Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\\nWill you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\\nthat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\\nWill you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\\nthe real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\\nfearful a mistake? --- All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\\ncan be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\\nin the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\\nmind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision\\nof the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a\\nmajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,\\nit might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such\\na right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of\\nminorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\\nand negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\\ncontroversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be\\nframed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may --- framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may\\noccur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,\\nnor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions\\nfor all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered\\nby national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.\\nMay Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not\\nexpressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?\\nThe Constitution does not expressly say. --- From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\\nThere is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\\nacquiescence on one side or the other.\\n\\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\\nthey make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\\nfor a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\\na majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.\\nFor instance, why may not any portion of a new\\nconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\\nprecisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\\nAll who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\\nexact temper of doing this.\\n\\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States\\nto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\\nand prevent renewed secession? --- Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\\nA majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\\nopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\\nWhoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\\nis wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\\nanarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left. --- I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny\\nthat such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties\\nto a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled\\nto very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\\ndepartments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that\\nsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\\nfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that\\nit may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\\ncan better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.\\nAt the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy\\nof the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,\\nis to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\\nthe instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties --- is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\\nthe instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties\\nin personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,\\nhaving to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands\\nof that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon\\nthe court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink\\nto decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of\\ntheirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. --- One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought\\nto be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought\\nnot to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.\\nThe fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the\\nsuppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,\\nperhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral\\nsense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.\\nThe great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\\nin both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,\\ncannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\\nAFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign\\nslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\\nnow only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\\nat all by the other. --- Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\\nrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of\\nthe presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different\\nparts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain\\nface to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,\\nmust continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make\\nthat intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\\nseparation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than\\nfriends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,\\nyou cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\\nan no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\\nas to terms of intercourse are again upon you. --- This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.\\nWhenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise\\ntheir CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right\\nto dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact\\nthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the\\nnational Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of\\namendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\\nover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed\\nin the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,\\nfavor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people\\nto act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode\\nseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with\\nthe people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or\\nreject propositions originated by others not especially chosen --- reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen\\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\\nwish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment\\nto the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has\\npassed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall\\nnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\\nincluding that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction\\nof what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\\namendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be\\nimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express\\nand irrevocable. --- The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,\\nand they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the\\nseparation of the states.  The people themselves can do this\\nalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to\\ndo with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,\\nas it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,\\nto his successor.\\n\\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice\\nof the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?\\nIn our present differences is either party without faith of being\\nin the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal\\ntruth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours\\nof the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,\\nby the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people. --- By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\\nhave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\\nand have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little\\nto their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain\\ntheir virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of\\nwickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government\\nin the short space of four years. --- My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this\\nwhole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.\\nIf there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step\\nwhich you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be\\nfrustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated\\nby it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the\\nold Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration\\nwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.\\nIf it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason\\nfor precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,\\nand a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,\\nare still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty. --- In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,\\nis the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.\\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\\nYOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_\\nshall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\"\\n\\nI am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not\\nbe enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break\\nour bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from\\nevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone\\nall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union\\nwhen again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\\n\\n***End of the Collected Etexts of Project Gutenberg of the 1970\\'s***\\n**We hope to rely on your continued support until the end of 2001,**\\nwhen we hope to have presented the 10,000th Project Gutenberg Etext!\\n\\n\\n\\n===============',\n",

Parting is such sweet sorrow\\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\\n\\n Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket. --- FRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nThe grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,\\nChequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\\nAnd fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels\\nFrom forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s fiery wheels\\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\\nThe day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours\\nWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\\nThe earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;\\nWhat is her burying grave, that is her womb:\\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\\nWe sucking on her natural bosom find.\\nMany for many virtues excellent,\\nNone but for some, and yet all different.\\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\\nIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\\nFor naught so vile that on the earth doth live\\nBut to the earth some special good doth give;\\nNor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,\\nRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\\nVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied,\\nAnd vice sometime’s by action dignified.\\n\\n Enter Romeo. --- Enter Romeo.\\n\\nWithin the infant rind of this weak flower\\nPoison hath residence, and medicine power:\\nFor this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\\nBeing tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\\nIn man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\\nFull soon the canker death eats up that plant.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGood morrow, father.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nBenedicite!\\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\\nYoung son, it argues a distemper’d head\\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\\nCare keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\\nAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie;\\nBut where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\\nTherefore thy earliness doth me assure\\nThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;\\nOr if not so, then here I hit it right,\\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline? --- ROMEO.\\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\\nI have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nThat’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\\nThat’s by me wounded.

What a change is here!\\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\\nAnd art thou chang’d?

The sweetest honey\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\n\\n Enter Juliet.\\n\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor. --- JULIET.\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\nSCENE I. A public Place.\\n\\n\\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants. --- NURSE.\\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\\nGod save the mark!—here on his manly breast.\\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,\\nAll in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nO, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.\\nTo prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.\\nVile earth to earth resign; end motion here,\\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.\\nO courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!\\nThat ever I should live to see thee dead.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?\\nIs Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?\\nMy dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?\\nThen dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,\\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,\\nRomeo that kill’d him, he is banished.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nO God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIt did, it did; alas the day, it did. --- JULIET.\\nBlister’d be thy tongue\\nFor such a wish!

I would forget it fain,\\nBut O, it presses to my memory\\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.\\nTybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’\\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there.\\nOr if sour woe delights in fellowship,\\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,\\nWhy follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both, --- Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both,\\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov’d?\\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,\\n‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\\nAll slain, all dead.

What is the Prince’s doom?\\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\\nThat I yet know not?\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nToo familiar\\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\\nMuch more than death. Do not say banishment.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\\nHence banished is banish’d from the world,\\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\\nIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me. --- FRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\\nAnd turn’d that black word death to banishment.\\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not. --- ROMEO.\\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\\nThey are free men but I am banished.\\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\\nHowling attends it. How hast thou the heart,\\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\\nTo mangle me with that word banished? --- FRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\\n\\nROMEO.\\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\nDisplant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\\n\\n [_Knocking within._]\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nArise; one knocks.

Thou hast\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.

Answer to that;\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad? --- NURSE.\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.

In this speech, Lincoln reflected on the war and its causes, and urged the nation to come together in reconciliation and healing. He emphasized the importance of forgiveness and the need to move forward, rather than dwelling on past grievances. Lincoln also expressed his hope that the war would soon come to an end and that the nation could begin the process of healing and rebuilding.\\n\\nLincoln's First Inaugural Address was delivered on March 4, 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War. In this speech, Lincoln sought to reassure the Southern states that he had no intention of interfering with slavery where it already existed, and he pledged to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States. He also emphasized the importance of the Union and the need to preserve it, and he urged the Southern states to remain in the Union and work towards a peaceful resolution of their differences. Lincoln's speech is considered a classic example of statesmanship and diplomacy, and it is often cited as a powerful expression of the importance of the Union and the rule of law.\", \" Chris Olande is a statistics and programming student at Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya, with a strong academic foundation in mathematics, statistics, and programming.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\\n4. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\\n5. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\n6. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\\n7. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\\n8. He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\\n9. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\\n10. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\\n11. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\\n12.

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences.\\n19. For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies.\\n20.
